Road Safety Analytics – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
------------------------------------------------------

Project Overview:
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a large-scale road accident dataset
to identify key patterns, trends, and risk factors contributing to traffic accidents.
The analysis is implemented as an interactive Streamlit web application.

Dataset:
Source: US Accidents Dataset
Records: Large-scale dataset (sampled/preprocessed as required)
Key attributes include accident severity, time, location, weather conditions,
road conditions, and visibility factors.

Project Structure:
- app.py                 : Main Streamlit application entry point
- modules/               : Contains modular analysis components
    - Home.py             : Project overview and dataset information
    - Preprocessing.py   : Data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing steps
    - Univariate_Analysis.py : Single-variable statistical analysis and visualizations
    - Comparative_Analysis.py : Bivariate and comparative analysis
    - Geospatial_Analysis.py  : Location-based accident analysis using maps
    - Insights_and_Hypothesis.py : Hypothesis formulation and testing
    - Key_Findings.py     : Summary of major insights and conclusions
- data/                  : Contains raw and preprocessed CSV datasets
- docs/                  : Project documentation and notes

Objectives:
1. Perform structured exploratory data analysis on road accident data.
2. Analyze accident severity distribution across time, weather, and location.
3. Identify significant variables influencing accident occurrence and severity.
4. Visualize spatial accident patterns using geospatial analysis.
5. Present insights through an interactive dashboard.

Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn (for basic modeling where applicable)
- Streamlit (for dashboard development)

Outcome:
The project provides meaningful insights into road safety patterns and demonstrates
the use of modular Python programming and interactive data visualization for
real-world data analysis tasks.
