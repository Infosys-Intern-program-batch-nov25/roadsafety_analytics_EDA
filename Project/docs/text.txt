RoadSafe Analytics:Road Accidents - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

1.Project Overview :

* This project, RoadSafe Analytics, focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents Dataset, which contains over 4 million road accident records. The project leverages Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights that can support road safety awareness and policy recommendations.
* To enhance usability and interpretability, the analysis results are presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.


2.Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To handle and preprocess a large real-world accident dataset

* To explore accident frequency based on time, location, weather, and road conditions

* To analyze accident severity using univariate and bivariate techniques

* To visualize geographical accident patterns and hotspots

* To derive actionable insights for road safety improvement

* To document findings clearly for technical and non-technical audiences
